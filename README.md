Implementation
Week 1: Setup, Core Development, and Basic Features Day 1-2: Project Setup and User Registration/Login Setup: Initialize your project with your chosen stack. Set up your GitHub repository, and plan your project structure. User Authentication: Implement user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication. Utilize libraries like Passport.js in a Node.js environment to manage user authentication. Day 3-4: Real-time Cryptocurrency Market Data API Integration: Choose a cryptocurrency API like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap. Implement functionality to fetch real-time prices, market cap, and volume data for various cryptocurrencies. Frontend Display: Develop the UI components to display this data dynamically on your dashboard. Day 5-7: Portfolio Management Database Schema: Design and implement the database schema for user portfolios, including cryptocurrency holdings. Add/Manage Holdings: Allow users to add cryptocurrencies to their portfolio, input quantities owned, and save this to their user profile. Portfolio Valuation: Implement logic to calculate the total value of the user's portfolio based on real-time market data. Week 2: Advanced Features and Polishing Day 8-9: Search and Filter Functionality Search Feature: Implement a search bar to allow users to find specific cryptocurrencies by name or ticker symbol. Filter Options: Add filters for users to sort cryptocurrencies based on criteria like market cap, price, or volume. Day 10-12: Security Features Data Protection: Ensure all user data is securely stored using encryption where necessary. Implement HTTPS for your app. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Add an option for 2FA at login for additional security. Day 13: Testing and Deployment Testing: Conduct thorough testing of all features, focusing on security, usability, and responsiveness. Use both automated tests (for the backend) and manual testing (for the frontend). Deployment: Deploy your application to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS. Make sure your database is securely configured and accessible by your application.

Endpoints
List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses. User POST /api/users/register

Description: Register a new user. Parameters: email, password, name Example Response: { success: true, message: "User registered successfully." } POST /api/users/login

Description: Authenticate a user. Parameters: email, password Example Response: { success: true, token: "Bearer " } Portfolio Management GET /api/portfolios

Description: Retrieve all portfolios for the logged-in user. Parameters: None (use user ID from token) Example Response: { portfolios: [{ portfolioID: "123", name: "Crypto Assets" }] }

Cryptocurrency Data GET /api/cryptocurrencies Description: Fetch a list of all available cryptocurrencies. Parameters: None Example Response: { cryptocurrencies: [{ cryptocurrencyID: "1", name: "Bitcoin", symbol: "BTC", currentPrice: 50000 }] }

Auth
User Registration: When registering, a user must provide an email address, create a password, and optionally, a username. The password is securely encrypted before being stored in the database. This encryption ensures that the original password remains confidential. User Login: For login, a user submits email and password. The system verifies the user's credentials by comparing the encrypted password with the one stored in the database. Upon successful verification, the system generates a JWT, which includes a coded user identifier and possibly additional information related to the user. This JWT is then sent back to the user and must be included in the header of subsequent requests to access restricted areas. This mechanism helps maintain secure access and user authentication throughout the platform. Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.
